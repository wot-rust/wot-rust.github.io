# Scope

## Joining and participation agreement

This document describes wot-rust's Code of Conduct for public communication mediums, who shall enforce said Code of Conduct, the action taken should the Code of Conduct be broken, as well as the method for appeals. Questions about this document and its contents can be directed to the [org issue tracker](https://github.com/wot-rust/wot-rust.github.io/issues).

This document is based on the [Gentoo Code of Conduct](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Council/Code_of_conduct)

> **Important**:
> By joining and/or participating in the wot-rust community, you are stating that you accept and agree to adhere to the rules listed below, even if you do not explicitly state so.

## Behaviour and consequences

### Acceptable behaviour

Things that should be seen:

- **Be courteous**. Though respect is earned, it must start somewhere. Respect someones right for their own opinion and acknowledge that they do deserve a measure of politeness in your response.
- **Give accurate information** in the spirit of being helpful.
- **Respectfully** disagree with or challenge other members. The operative word here is respectfully.
- **Use the correct forum and stay in-topic**, use [the forum](https://github.com/wot-rust/wot/discussions) for brainstorming and not the issue tracker.
- **Admit the possibility of fault** and respect different point of views. **Noone is perfect** â€“ you will get things wrong occasionally. Don't be afraid to admit this. Similarly, while something may seem perfectly obvious to you, others may see it differently.
- If you screw up, **take responsibility** for your actions.

### Unacceptable behaviour

wot-rust developers have come together with a common purpose, to further the project. Conflicts will undoubtedly arise, and though you are encouraged to work through issues on your own, assistance is available as requested and as needed.

Deciding to suspend or ban someone isn't a decision to be taken lightly, but sometimes it has to happen. Below is a list of things that could result in disciplinary action.

- **Flaming and trolling.** What is trolling? You are deemed to be trolling if you make comments intended to provoke an angry response from others. What is flaming? Flaming is the act of sending or posting messages that are deliberately hostile and insulting.
- **Posting/participating only to incite drama** or negativity rather than to tactfully share information.
- **Being judgmental, mean-spirited or insulting.** It is possible to respectfully challenge someone in a way that empowers without being judgemental.
- **Constantly purveying misinformation** despite repeated warnings.
- **Being blatantly off-topic**, the issue trackers are only for technical discussion, the irc channel is more relaxed but if somebody ask you to not discuss non-tecnical issues you feel strong about, please stop.

The code, issue tracker and irc channel has **no room** for any divisive non-technical topics, e.g: **any derogatory statement** on race, gender, sexual orientation, personal or political values is prohibited.

### Consequences

Long-term disciplinary action will be up to the discretion of the project maintainers (currently [@lu-zero](https://github.com/lu-zero) and [@dodomorandi](https://github.com/dodomorandi)), temporary disciplinary action will be up to the discretion of the channel moderators (e.g. irc op).

If you perceive a breach of the Code of Conduct guidelines, let the appropriate people know.

Please make an effort to just make the people involved aware of that first and do not further engage in discussion if the other party does not recognize the breach.

Repeated breaches will result in the temporal or permanent removal from the community communication media of the people involved.

## Summary

If you are unsure whether or not something is OK to post/comment/etc, assume it isn't, and reconsider whether you need to post it. Remember that posts made to the issue tracker and pull requests might be archived for perpetuity, and read by far more people than will be actively involved in any one thread. A comment made in anger can have far-reaching consequences that you might not have thought about at the time.
