The current release policy for the projects is not currently strictly time-bound, but we'll try to get a new set of releases at least every season.

## Spring

Our Spring releases highlights are the following:

- [wot-td](https://github.com/sifis-home/wot-td) Now provides initial support for the [Protocol Binding Templates](https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/#protocol-bindings) and has few usability improvements to make estensions to the `FormBuilder`.
- [wot-serve](https://github.com/sifis-home/wot-serve) Received some fixes and few additional features as it gets used in the [SIFIS-Home demos](https://github.com/sifis-home/demo-things) and we start having some reports regarding interoperability with other implementations (Thank you Ben!).
